Overview

This Python program takes marks of students as input and processes them using loops and conditional statements. The program adjusts marks based on a fixed number and classifies them into different grade -categories. It also counts the number of valid students and failed students.

 Takes number of students as input
 Stores marks using a list
 Modifies marks based on a fixed number condition

How It Works

User enters the size of the list (number of students).

Program takes marks for each student.

A fixed number (668) is checked.

Since 668 is even, 2 marks are added to every student’s score.

Each updated mark is evaluated and assigned a grade category.

The program prints:

Grade for each student

Total valid students

Total failed students
